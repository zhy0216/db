# Cursor implementation loss audit

2026-09-15. Base `3c54e89ae`, uncommitted cursor helper and tests.

The frozen candidate was the 143-line Query-owned `createCursorPager`, its
documentation and 87 passing tests. Two fresh, source-isolated agents scanned
the issue and historical plans separately. A third fresh agent was unavailable;
the implementing agent checked the oracle guide. That last pass is correlated,
not an independent sign-off. These are loss traces, not a completeness proof.

## Oracle-guide pass and recovered tests

This pass shares the implementer's context; it is weaker than the two isolated
readings above. It compares promises and test evidence, not every possible state.

## Evidence after recovery

Before audit recovery: package 341 tests passed, types/lint/build passed;
100× seed 863 passed 87 tests and 60,000 generated histories. Recovery adds
two tests and strengthens four existing integration cells; final receipts are
recorded in README after rerunning the gates.

Browser ESM, esbuild minification, target ES2020, same checkout/settings:
`queryCollectionOptions` alone: 46,590 bytes / 14,985 gzip.
Adding `createCursorPager`: 50,667 bytes / 16,475 gzip (+4,077 / +1,490).
This is an opt-in diagnostic import comparison, not every application's bundle
or an all-core comparison. The helper adds no core/hook source changes.

## Subsequent prep-pr corrections

The earlier cancellation witness covered only an initial request, where Query
has no cached result to restore. Review found that growth/refresh cancellation
could return the old cache as success and trigger another transport. It also
found that inherited `maxPages` evicted the prefix addressed by offset reads and
inherited `select` changed the observer's page format. The earlier cache model
was small enough; its configuration and scheduling domains were too narrow.

The expanded oracle crosses global/key defaults with selection/page eviction
and generated growth, backward windows and invalidation. Cancellation now crosses
initial/growth/refresh, page size/depth, shared waiters, late response delivery
and subsequent recovery. The real peer fetch join is observed before cancellation;
a shallow cache hit is checked while a deeper peer remains held.

Before the production fixes, eight of the expanded suite's 17 cells failed;
afterward all pass. Seed 863 minimized failing size/depth inputs to `[1, 1]`.
The fixes disable incompatible internal-page defaults and preserve Query's raw
acquisition rejection without blocking fresh cache hits. No reference-model
branch was added to imitate Query internals. Final full-package/stress/build
receipts and updated size measurements are in README; the measurements above
describe the earlier audit candidate, not the final helper.

The audit can itself turn old suggestions into obligations or over-rescue
interesting detail. The tables separate source observations from the later
scope dispositions. They do not infer consensus among issue commenters or
certify that the implementation has no undiscovered bugs.

## Cache publication review

The next external review exposed two further false-green boundaries. The cache
history awaited every read, so it never invalidated during growth. The repeated
cursor test observed rejection, but not whether invalid data had already been
published or whether a later read could recover.

The publication oracle keeps the same full-relation reference. It adds:

- Immutable cursor sequences with held suffix delivery, a real active outer
  QueryObserver, and the documented cancel-then-invalidate procedure. Omitting
  cancellation is a fault control rejected by the same row checker.
- Growth and refresh with a malformed final continuation, generated page sizes,
  depths and backward token targets, shared waiters, and Query retry enabled or
  disabled. Assertions cover rejection, no successful cache publication, retained
  last-good data, repair, and a subsequent fresh cache hit.
- Generated cached windows checked against full filter/sort/slice truth, with
  row-access counts requiring work proportional to the returned slice rather
  than all cached rows.

Before fixes, all four initial cells failed with seed 863. Growth/refresh
protocol failures shrank to size/depth/target `[1, 1, 0]`, where an invalid
acquisition emitted a successful cache publication. The slice failure shrank
to `[1, 1, undefined]`: a beyond-end empty read still accessed the cached row.
The held-growth failure returned version 0 after a required version-1 refresh.

Refresh is a documented procedure correction, not a new invalidation engine.
The driver now cancels before invalidating; the old procedure remains a negative
control. Protocol validation moved into response acquisition, before Query can
publish or resolve shared waiters. Its weakly held token set lasts only as long
as the acquisition signal; cached page parameters seed later growth. Slice
collection adds no persistent state. No production reference model, core query
change, metadata API or no-peek feature was added.

## Nested acquisition and fixture review

The next review tested boundaries the standalone cache oracle did not own:
an actual outer QueryCollection, browser retry defaults, aborting a queued reader,
and manual row writes. Nine boundary checks failed before fixes; a separate
generated manual-write law reproduced the documented prefix collision.

- The browser boundary oracle uses real QueryCollection preload and Query state.
  Page cancellation must settle the outer row query with an ordinary AbortError;
  silently replaced acquisitions must deliver the replacement's new values.
  It also checks prompt reader abort without transport cancellation, fresh reads
  beside same-turn cancellation, global/default retry consistency, legacy signals,
  invalid response/cache continuations, and unrelated-query hash work.
- Actual acquisitions and cache hits now follow separate paths. One Query observer
  identifies its current query directly; the cache no longer gets scanned per page.
  Readers follow silent replacements and translate explicit acquisition cancellation
  out of Query's internal control-error type. Aborted readers release the queue
  without canceling the shared transport; generation/reset isolation stays intact.
- The documented row/page keys are siblings beneath a resource prefix. The manual
  write law crosses insert/update/delete and sizes, retaining exact public row
  values and unchanged page-cache records. This fixes the recipe, not QueryCollection's
  intentional prefix-wide manual-write behavior.
- CodeRabbit's late-delivery observations now await a transport marker and drain
  the promise work before checking cache fences. Its backend fixture finding is
  covered by unique sequence namespaces and a generated foreign-token rejection
  law. Fixed `next` tokens in the boundary suite still exercise lawful reuse across
  sequential acquisitions; fixture isolation is not a new backend API requirement.

The reference relation remains unchanged. Undefined continuations are not valid
under the null-only protocol: the helper now gives a clear error, rejects malformed
cached continuations instead of looping, and the example normalizes an endpoint's
omitted terminal cursor. Full-prefix stale refresh and independent cache GC are
retained Query semantics. No-peek experiments remain valuable tests, not shipping
features. The maintainer's patch-release and partial-closeout decisions stand.

## Follow-up: defensive cache writes and queued refresh

The manual-write oracle now varies raw versus selected responses, sibling versus
nested page keys for raw responses, and generated insert/update/delete histories.
It checks exact collection rows, row-cache contents, selected wrapper metadata,
seeding an empty raw cache, and the full untouched page-query state. The reference
is still an independent array; no Query cache state machine was added.

The nested raw-cache cell failed before the guard, shrinking to one insert and
two initial rows (seed -441317402, path 0:0:0:0). A deliberate guard mutant which
called setQueryData with the unchanged page object also failed: that call clears
invalidation and changes freshness despite preserving the rows. The final guard
does not call setQueryData for an existing non-array record in the raw write path.
Selected response writes are unchanged. Mixed selected/page caches under one
prefix remain unsupported; the guide still prescribes sibling prefixes.

The existing forced-refresh oracle now crosses new-per-call and retained pagers.
With a retained pager, the old growth can finish before a queued read observes
invalidation. Cancel-then-invalidate passes both paths. Invalidation alone remains
a negative control in both; the scratch cancelRefetch-on-invalidated candidate
repairs only the new-pager path. Automatic invalidation repair would require a
separate contract decision, not merely that one-line option change.
