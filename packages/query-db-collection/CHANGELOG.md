# @tanstack/query-db-collection

## 1.2.16

### Patch Changes

- Add `createCursorPager` to fulfill offset/limit requests from endpoints with opaque continuation tokens. Reuse fresh backend pages through the existing QueryClient, with Query-managed expiry, invalidation and garbage collection, while retaining the existing UI peek-ahead behavior. ([#1824](https://github.com/TanStack/db/pull/1824))

  Keep manual raw-row writes from overwriting other cache formats or marking them fresh. Preserve wrapped-response writes and seeding of empty row caches.

- Keep on-demand Query cache ownership and post-write readiness isolated across collections, co-owners, deferred cleanup, errors, and custom query hashes. Active enabled scopes revalidate from post-write provider results, while inactive collection-owned entries are removed without disturbing unrelated or foreign-observed Queries. ([#1826](https://github.com/TanStack/db/pull/1826))

  - @tanstack/db@0.9.1

## 1.2.13

### Patch Changes

- Fix on-demand load settlement, ordered pagination, and replay to preserve coherent results across cancellation, failure, cleanup, and restart. Preserve subset results and ownership across Electric, PowerSync, Query, and SQLite persistence adapters. Correct live-query grouping, include projections, value identity, and indexed comparisons. D2 hashing now rejects structural cycles and excessive traversal depth or work with an explicit error; Collection handles retain object-reference identity without traversing their mutable contents. ([#1797](https://github.com/TanStack/db/pull/1797))

  Remove the unused public subset-algebra helpers: `isWhereSubset`, `unionWherePredicates`, `minusWherePredicates`, `isOrderBySubset`, `isLimitSubset`, `isOffsetLimitSubset`, `isPredicateSubset`, and `isLoadSubsetRequestSubsumedBy`. Apps that import these helpers must remove those imports; normal queries and adapters are unaffected. `DeduplicatedLoadSubset` remains available and shares only exact demand identities.

  Reject compiled Collection-valued includes as `fn.select()` inputs, including nested descendants, before invoking the callback. Use `toArray()` or `materialize()` in the upstream `.select()` for child-value calculations. To keep live child Collections, use expression `.select()` or perform parent-only functional work before adding the includes. Ordinary Collection-valued includes remain supported.

  Remove proxy `DEBUG` logging and automatic index timing statistics to avoid diagnostic work on reads and writes. Remove `getStats()` and `IndexStats`; use `index.keyCount` for the current entry count, and instrument index methods externally when profiling. Custom index subclasses must remove calls to the retired `trackLookup()` and `updateTimestamp()` helpers.

  Fix mutation drafts so Map/Set `forEach` calls each callback once and read-only iteration reports no changes. Track nested Map `for...of` edits through `collection.update()`. Keep Set entries in place during nested edits, preserving live iteration and usable `has`, `delete`, and `add` handles without duplicate entries or repeated visits. Reverting one entry no longer discards another entry's pending changes.

  Preserve shared values within a row's draft. Newly supplied objects use normal shared references during the update callback, including Map values and Set members; editing through either handle changes the same new object. Copy completed changes at callback return so later caller edits cannot mutate stored data. Existing collection values remain isolated. Copy a new caller-owned value before insertion if it must remain untouched during the callback.

  Keep rejected local-storage mutations out of later successful saves. Stage insert, update, delete, and manual transaction writes before persisting, then promote the shared cache only after storage succeeds.

  Deliver live-query observer publications to peer listeners even when one listener throws. Preserve queued publication order and stop delivery on disposal; report the first listener failure after delivery.

  Wait for PowerSync demands admitted during tracking finalization before reporting them loaded. Preserve untouched object and array key identity when they contain `NaN`. Retire every failed ordered acquisition on explicit retry, while retaining a full-source demand repaired by replay.

  After authoritative ordered recovery succeeds, retire settled page and tie demands so later truncate replay fetches only the full-source replacement. Keep unfinished requests observed until settlement and preserve independent query ownership.

  Remove the live-query `utils.getRunCount()` diagnostic and its runtime counter. Apps that call this diagnostic must remove those calls. Query scheduling and results are unchanged.

  Remove test-only index inspection getters (`indexedKeysSet`, `valueMapData`, `orderedEntriesArray`, and `orderedEntriesArrayReversed`) and unused scheduler diagnostics. `ReverseIndex` now exposes only the `IndexReader` lookup, range, and forward traversal surface returned by `findIndexForField`; mutate the original index instead. Export `IndexReader` for callers that name this return type. Remove the unused subscription `releaseLoadSubset()` method; request owners use the release callback supplied by `onLoadSubsetResult`. Ordinary query and adapter APIs remain unchanged by these removals.

  Remove unused internal helpers and the unused public error classes `WhereClauseConversionError`, `SubscriptionNotFoundError`, and `AggregateNotSupportedError`. These classes have no remaining runtime throw sites; remove any imports of them. Keep the existing query and index behavior and exercise identity/evaluation tests through the production entry points.

  Ensure failed mutations roll back even when their rejection value cannot be converted to a string. Preserve ordinary Error instances; report unprintable rejection values as `Unknown error`.

  Make reentrant effect disposal share the active cleanup result, including calls from abort listeners or source release callbacks. A release failure reaches every waiting disposer while each source still receives one release attempt.

  Reject starting or preloading a collection from inside its active cleanup callbacks with a clear `CollectionStateError`. Nested cleanup cannot admit replacement work that the old teardown would discard. Restart after cleanup completes, or from its final `cleaned-up` status event, remains supported.

  Prevent older page or tie-boundary completions from clearing a newer full-source failure or starting redundant loading. Failed window moves retain their settled public snapshot; an explicit retry releases the failed acquisition once and publishes the completed replacement.

  Restrict direct subscription `requestLimitedSnapshot()` cursor inputs to one order term and one `minValues` entry. Composite and partial-composite cursor inputs now throw before local delivery or adapter work. Use normal live-query ordering and window APIs for multi-column pagination; those remain supported through prefix-and-tie loading. Existing adapters need no changes.

  Treat `LoadSubsetOptions` and their nested request data as immutable from submission onward. Core no longer copies expression trees or mutable constant payloads at the sync and deduplication boundaries. Create a new Date, byte array, membership array, or options object when changing a demand instead of mutating submitted data. Adapters must also leave request data unchanged. Use stable data properties rather than stateful getters. `AbortSignal` cancellation and subscription release remain live.

  Replace replay acquisitions sequentially: release the prior physical lease before starting its replacement. The logical demand and last complete public result remain retained. A failed release prevents replacement startup; failed startup leaves demand available for a later authoritative replay. Custom adapters must support a release/load gap and preserve resources still held by other owners; a sole underlying resource may stop and restart.

## 1.2.10

### Patch Changes

- Canonicalize equivalent loadSubset queries to one demand identity while preserving observable output aliases, exact projected values, and distinct ordered windows. Query DB now reuses the same canonical identity for its on-demand cache keys. ([#1768](https://github.com/TanStack/db/pull/1768))

- Settle subset loads only after their committed rows and events are visible. A ([#1769](https://github.com/TanStack/db/pull/1769))
  commit receipt now rejects with `AbortError` when cancellation wins before
  application and ignores later aborts. Preserve causal publication,
  cancellation, persistence, and error handling across the affected sync
  adapters.

  - @tanstack/db@0.8.3

## 1.2.7

### Patch Changes

- Propagate initial query sync failures through dependent live queries and readiness promises, including recovery and late subscribers, while preserving a ready cached snapshot on later refetch failures. Let sync adapters pass the original failure to `markError(error)` so readiness promises reject with that cause. Isolate adapter callbacks by sync session, preserve synchronous startup errors, and prevent rejected deduplicated subset requests from creating detached promise rejections.

## 1.2.6

### Patch Changes

## 1.2.5

### Patch Changes

- Add SSR through request-scoped `DbClient` instances, collection descriptors, ([#1564](https://github.com/TanStack/db/pull/1564))
  explicit collection-row hydration, live-query result snapshots, adapter sync
  metadata, and React and Svelte descriptor resolution.

  React live queries now derive identity from structured query IR. Opaque queries
  can provide `queryKey`; legacy dependency arrays and unkeyed opaque queries keep
  working with development warnings until 1.0.

  Add TanStack Router integration that streams live queries discovered during a
  Suspense render as pending promises which resolve to ordered result snapshots.
  The browser starts normal source sync and atomically replaces the snapshot when
  its live result is ready.

## 1.0.31

### Patch Changes

- fix: prevent stale query refreshes from overwriting optimistic offline changes on reconnect ([#1390](https://github.com/TanStack/db/pull/1390))

  When reconnecting with pending offline transactions, query-backed collections now defer processing query refreshes until queued writes finish replaying, avoiding temporary reverts to stale server data.

- fix: default persisted query retention to gcTime when omitted ([#1400](https://github.com/TanStack/db/pull/1400))

  When `persistedGcTime` is not provided, query collections now use the query's effective `gcTime` as the persisted retention TTL. This prevents unexpectedly early cleanup of persisted rows.

- fix: Prevent stale query cache from re-inserting deleted items when a destroyed observer is recreated with gcTime > 0. ([#1387](https://github.com/TanStack/db/pull/1387))

### Patch Changes

- Improve `queryCollectionOptions` type compatibility with TanStack Query option objects. ([#1289](https://github.com/TanStack/db/pull/1289))
  - Accept `queryFn` return types of `T | Promise<T>` instead of requiring `Promise<T>`.

  - Support tagged `queryKey` values (`DataTag`) from `queryOptions(...)` spread usage.
  - Preserve runtime safety: query collections still require an executable `queryFn`, and wrapped responses still require `select`.

## 1.0.19

### Patch Changes

- Fix updating all active query caches on directWrite for on-demand collections.Previously directWrite operations (e.g. writeUpdate/writeInsert) only updated the cache at the base query key for on-demand collections, leading to stale data when components remounted. This change ensures all active query cache keys are updated so data persists correctly. ([#1155](https://github.com/TanStack/db/pull/1155))

## 1.0.8

### Patch Changes

- Fix writeInsert/writeUpsert throwing error when collection uses select option ([#1023](https://github.com/TanStack/db/pull/1023))

  When a Query Collection was configured with a `select` option to extract items from a wrapped API response (e.g., `{ data: [...], meta: {...} }`), calling `writeInsert()` or `writeUpsert()` would corrupt the query cache and trigger the error: "select() must return an array of objects".

  The fix routes cache updates through a new `updateCacheData` function that preserves the wrapper structure by using the `select` function to identify which property contains the items array (via reference equality), then updates only that property while keeping metadata intact.

## 1.0.7

### Patch Changes

- Enhanced LoadSubsetOptions with separate cursor expressions and offset for flexible pagination. ([#960](https://github.com/TanStack/db/pull/960))

  **⚠️ Breaking Change for Custom Sync Layers / Query Collections:**

  `LoadSubsetOptions.where` no longer includes cursor expressions for pagination. If you have a custom sync layer or query collection that implements `loadSubset`, you must now handle pagination separately:
  - **Cursor-based pagination:** Use the new `cursor` property (`cursor.whereFrom` and `cursor.whereCurrent`) and combine them with `where` yourself
  - **Offset-based pagination:** Use the new `offset` property

  Previously, cursor expressions were baked into the `where` clause. Now they are passed separately so sync layers can choose their preferred pagination strategy.

  **Changes:**
  - Added `CursorExpressions` type with `whereFrom`, `whereCurrent`, and optional `lastKey` properties
  - Added `cursor` to `LoadSubsetOptions` for cursor-based pagination (separate from `where`)
  - Added `offset` to `LoadSubsetOptions` for offset-based pagination support
  - Electric sync layer now makes two parallel `requestSnapshot` calls when cursor is present:
    - One for `whereCurrent` (all ties at boundary, no limit)
    - One for `whereFrom` (rows after cursor, with limit)
  - Query collection serialization now includes `offset` for query key generation
  - Added `truncate` event to collections, emitted when synced data is truncated (e.g., after `must-refetch`)
  - Fixed `setWindow` pagination: cursor expressions are now correctly built when paging through results
  - Fixed offset tracking: `loadNextItems` now passes the correct window offset to prevent incorrect deduplication
  - `CollectionSubscriber` now listens for `truncate` events to reset cursor tracking state

  **Benefits:**
  - Sync layers can choose between cursor-based or offset-based pagination strategies
  - Electric can efficiently handle tie-breaking with two targeted requests
  - Better separation of concerns between filtering (`where`) and pagination (`cursor`/`offset`)
  - `setWindow` correctly triggers backend loading for subsequent pages in multi-column orderBy queries
  - Cursor state is properly reset after truncation, preventing stale cursor data from being used

## 1.0.6

### Patch Changes

- fix(query-db-collection): use deep equality for object field comparison in query observer ([#967](https://github.com/TanStack/db/pull/967))

  Fixed an issue where updating object fields (non-primitives) with `refetch: false` in `onUpdate` handlers would cause the value to rollback to the previous state every other update. The query observer was using shallow equality (`===`) to compare items, which compares object properties by reference rather than by value. This caused the observer to incorrectly detect differences and write stale data back to syncedData. Now uses `deepEquals` for proper value comparison.

## 1.0.5

### Patch Changes

- fix: ensure ctx.meta.loadSubsetOptions type-safety works automatically ([#869](https://github.com/TanStack/db/pull/869))

  The module augmentation for ctx.meta.loadSubsetOptions is now guaranteed to load automatically when importing from @tanstack/query-db-collection. Previously, users needed to explicitly import QueryCollectionMeta or use @ts-ignore to pass ctx.meta?.loadSubsetOptions to parseLoadSubsetOptions.

  Additionally, QueryCollectionMeta is now an interface (instead of a type alias), enabling users to safely extend meta with custom properties via declaration merging:

  ```typescript
  declare module '@tanstack/query-db-collection' {
    interface QueryCollectionMeta {
      myCustomProperty: string
    }
  }
  ```

## 1.0.4

### Patch Changes

- Fix data loss on component remount by implementing reference counting for QueryObserver lifecycle ([#870](https://github.com/TanStack/db/pull/870))

  **What changed vs main:**

  Previously, when live query subscriptions unsubscribed, there was no tracking of which rows were still needed by other active queries. This caused data loss during remounts.

  This PR adds reference counting infrastructure to properly manage QueryObserver lifecycle:
  1. Pass same predicates to `unloadSubset` that were passed to `loadSubset`
  2. Use them to compute the queryKey (via `generateQueryKeyFromOptions`)
  3. Use existing machinery (`queryToRows` map) to find rows that query loaded
  4. Decrement the ref count
  5. GC rows where count reaches 0 (no longer referenced by any active query)

  **Impact:**
  - Navigation back to previously loaded pages shows cached data immediately
  - No unnecessary refetches during quick remounts (< gcTime)
  - Multiple live queries with identical predicates correctly share QueryObservers
  - Proper row-level cleanup when last subscriber leaves
  - TanStack Query's cache lifecycle (gcTime) is fully respected
  - No data leakage from in-flight requests when unsubscribing

- Updated dependencies [[`077fc1a`](https://github.com/TanStack/db/commit/077fc1a418ca090d7533115888c09f3f609e36b2)]:

## 1.0.3

### Patch Changes

- Improved the type of the queryFn's ctx.meta property of the Query Collection to include the loadSubsetOptions ([#857](https://github.com/TanStack/db/pull/857))

- Fixed bug where optimistic state leaked into syncedData when using writeInsert inside onInsert handlers. Previously, when syncing server-generated fields (like IDs or timestamps) using writeInsert within an onInsert handler, the QueryClient cache was updated with combined visible state (including optimistic changes), which triggered the query observer to write optimistic values back to syncedData. Now the cache is correctly updated with only server-confirmed state, ensuring syncedData maintains separation from optimistic state. ([#879](https://github.com/TanStack/db/pull/879))

## 1.0.2

### Patch Changes

- Automatically append predicates to static queryKey in on-demand mode. ([#800](https://github.com/TanStack/db/pull/800))

  When using a static `queryKey` with `syncMode: 'on-demand'`, the system now automatically appends serialized LoadSubsetOptions to create unique cache keys for different predicate combinations. This fixes an issue where all live queries with different predicates would share the same TanStack Query cache entry, causing data to be overwritten.

  **Before:**

  ```typescript
  // This would cause conflicts between different queries
  queryCollectionOptions({
    queryKey: ['products'], // Static key
    syncMode: 'on-demand',
    queryFn: async (ctx) => {
      const { where, limit } = ctx.meta.loadSubsetOptions
      return fetch(`/api/products?...`).then((r) => r.json())
    },
  })
  ```

  With different live queries filtering by `category='A'` and `category='B'`, both would share the same cache key `['products']`, causing the last query to overwrite the first.

  **After:**
  Static queryKeys now work correctly in on-demand mode! The system automatically creates unique cache keys:
  - Query with `category='A'` → `['products', '{"where":{...A...}}']`
  - Query with `category='B'` → `['products', '{"where":{...B...}}']`

  **Key behaviors:**
  - ✅ Static queryKeys now work correctly with on-demand mode (automatic serialization)
  - ✅ Function-based queryKeys continue to work as before (no change)
  - ✅ Eager mode with static queryKeys unchanged (no automatic serialization)
  - ✅ Identical predicates correctly reuse the same cache entry

  This makes the documentation example work correctly without requiring users to manually implement function-based queryKeys for predicate push-down.

## 1.0.0

### Patch Changes

- Add expression helper utilities for parsing LoadSubsetOptions in queryFn. ([#763](https://github.com/TanStack/db/pull/763))

  When using `syncMode: 'on-demand'`, TanStack DB now provides helper functions to easily parse where clauses, orderBy, and limit predicates into your API's format:
  - `parseWhereExpression`: Parse where clauses with custom handlers for each operator
  - `parseOrderByExpression`: Parse order by into simple array format
  - `extractSimpleComparisons`: Extract simple AND-ed filters
  - `parseLoadSubsetOptions`: Convenience function to parse all options at once
  - `walkExpression`, `extractFieldPath`, `extractValue`: Lower-level helpers

  **Example:**

  ```typescript
  import { parseLoadSubsetOptions } from '@tanstack/db'
  // or from "@tanstack/query-db-collection" (re-exported for convenience)

  queryFn: async (ctx) => {
    const { where, orderBy, limit } = ctx.meta.loadSubsetOptions

    const parsed = parseLoadSubsetOptions({ where, orderBy, limit })

    // Build API request from parsed filters
    const params = new URLSearchParams()
    parsed.filters.forEach(({ field, operator, value }) => {
      if (operator === 'eq') {
        params.set(field.join('.'), String(value))
      }
    })

    return fetch(`/api/products?${params}`).then((r) => r.json())
  }
  ```

  This eliminates the need to manually traverse expression AST trees when implementing predicate push-down.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- Add QueryObserver state utilities and convert error utils to getters ([#742](https://github.com/TanStack/db/pull/742))

  Exposes TanStack Query's QueryObserver state through QueryCollectionUtils, providing visibility into sync status beyond just error states. Also converts existing error state utilities from methods to getters for consistency with TanStack DB/Query patterns.

  **Breaking Changes:**
  - `lastError()`, `isError()`, and `errorCount()` are now getters instead of methods
    - Before: `collection.utils.lastError()`
    - After: `collection.utils.lastError`

  **New Utilities:**
  - `isFetching` - Check if query is currently fetching (initial or background)
  - `isRefetching` - Check if query is refetching in background
  - `isLoading` - Check if query is loading for first time
  - `dataUpdatedAt` - Get timestamp of last successful data update
  - `fetchStatus` - Get current fetch status ('fetching' | 'paused' | 'idle')

  **Use Cases:**
  - Show loading indicators during background refetches
  - Implement "Last updated X minutes ago" UI patterns
  - Better understanding of query sync behavior

  **Example Usage:**

  ```ts
  const collection = queryCollectionOptions({
    // ... config
  })

  // Check sync status
  if (collection.utils.isFetching) {
    console.log('Syncing with server...')
  }

  if (collection.utils.isRefetching) {
    console.log('Background refresh in progress')
  }

  // Show last update time
  const lastUpdate = new Date(collection.utils.dataUpdatedAt)

### Patch Changes

- Fix dependency bundling issues by moving @tanstack/db to peerDependencies ([#766](https://github.com/TanStack/db/pull/766))

  **What Changed:**

  Moved `@tanstack/db` from regular dependencies to peerDependencies in:
  - `@tanstack/offline-transactions`
  - `@tanstack/query-db-collection`

  Removed `@opentelemetry/api` dependency from `@tanstack/offline-transactions`.

  **Why:**

  These extension packages incorrectly declared `@tanstack/db` as both a regular dependency AND a peerDependency simultaneously. This caused lock files to develop conflicting versions, resulting in multiple instances of `@tanstack/db` being installed in consuming applications.

  The fix removes `@tanstack/db` from regular dependencies and keeps it only as a peerDependency. This ensures only one version of `@tanstack/db` is installed in the dependency tree, preventing version conflicts.

  For local development, `@tanstack/db` remains in devDependencies so the packages can be built and tested independently.

## 0.2.37

### Patch Changes

- **Behavior change**: `utils.refetch()` now uses exact query key targeting (previously used prefix matching). This prevents unintended cascading refetches of related queries. For example, refetching `['todos', 'project-1']` will no longer trigger refetches of `['todos']` or `['todos', 'project-2']`. ([#552](https://github.com/TanStack/db/pull/552))

  Additionally, `utils.refetch()` now bypasses `enabled: false` to support manual/imperative refetch patterns (matching TanStack Query hook behavior) and returns `QueryObserverResult` instead of `void` for better DX.

## 0.2.34

### Patch Changes

- Fix queryCollectionOptions to respect QueryClient defaultOptions when not overridden ([#707](https://github.com/TanStack/db/pull/707))

  Previously, when creating a QueryClient with defaultOptions (e.g., staleTime, retry, refetchOnWindowFocus), these options were ignored by queryCollectionOptions unless explicitly specified again in the collection config. This required duplicating configuration and prevented users from setting global defaults.

  Now, queryCollectionOptions properly respects the QueryClient's defaultOptions as fallbacks. Options explicitly provided in queryCollectionOptions will still override the defaults.

  Example - this now works as expected:

  ```typescript
  const dbQueryClient = new QueryClient({
    defaultOptions: {
      queries: {
        refetchOnWindowFocus: false,
        staleTime: Infinity,
      },
    },
  })

  queryCollectionOptions({
    id: 'wallet-accounts',
    queryKey: ['wallet-accounts'],
    queryClient: dbQueryClient,
    // staleTime: Infinity is now inherited from defaultOptions
  })
  ```

- Fix writeDelete/writeUpdate validation to check synced store only ([#708](https://github.com/TanStack/db/pull/708))

  Fixed issue where calling `writeDelete()` or `writeUpdate()` inside mutation handlers (like `onDelete`) would throw errors when optimistic updates were active. These write operations now correctly validate against the synced store only, not the combined view (synced + optimistic).

  This allows patterns like calling `writeDelete()` inside an `onDelete` handler to work correctly, enabling users to write directly to the synced store while the mutation is being persisted to the backend.

  Fixes #706

### Patch Changes

- Fix collection.preload() hanging when called without startSync or subscribers.

## 0.2.23

### Patch Changes

- Fix `staleTime` behavior by automatically subscribing/unsubscribing from TanStack Query based on collection subscriber count. ([#462](https://github.com/TanStack/db/pull/462))

  Previously, query collections kept a QueryObserver permanently subscribed, which broke TanStack Query's `staleTime` and window-focus refetch behavior. Now the QueryObserver properly goes inactive when the collection has no subscribers, restoring normal `staleTime`/`gcTime` semantics.

- query-collection now supports a `select` function to transform raw query results into an array of items. This is useful for APIs that return data with metadata or nested structures, ensuring metadata remains cached while collections work with the unwrapped array.

  - @tanstack/db@0.1.1

## 0.1.2

### Patch Changes

- Move @tanstack/query-core from dependencies to peerDependencies to avoid version conflicts when users already have react-query or query-core installed. This is a non-breaking change as the package will continue to work with any 5.x version of query-core. ([#351](https://github.com/TanStack/db/pull/351))

## 0.1.1

### Patch Changes

- Add manual write methods to QueryCollectionUtils interface to enable direct state updates from external sources. Introduces writeInsert, writeUpdate, writeDelete, writeUpsert, and writeBatch methods that bypass the normal optimistic update flow for WebSocket/real-time scenarios. All methods include proper transaction handling, data validation, and automatic query cache synchronization. ([#303](https://github.com/TanStack/db/pull/303))

### Patch Changes

- Fix LiveQueryCollection hanging when source collections have no data ([#309](https://github.com/TanStack/db/pull/309))

  Fixed an issue where `LiveQueryCollection.preload()` would hang indefinitely when source collections call `markReady()` without data changes (e.g., when queryFn returns empty array).

  The fix implements a proper event-based solution:
  - Collections now emit empty change events when becoming ready with no data
  - WHERE clause filtered subscriptions now correctly pass through empty ready signals
  - Both regular and WHERE clause optimized LiveQueryCollections now work correctly with empty source collections

### Patch Changes

- feat: Replace string-based errors with named error classes for better error handling ([#297](https://github.com/TanStack/db/pull/297))

  This comprehensive update replaces all string-based error throws throughout the TanStack DB codebase with named error classes, providing better type safety and developer experience.

  ## New Features
  - **Root `TanStackDBError` class** - all errors inherit from a common base for unified error handling
  - **Named error classes** organized by package and functional area
  - **Type-safe error handling** using `instanceof` checks instead of string matching
  - **Package-specific error definitions** - each adapter has its own error classes
  - **Better IDE support** with autocomplete for error types

  ## Package Structure

  ### Core Package (`@tanstack/db`)

  Contains generic errors used across the ecosystem:
  - Collection configuration, state, and operation errors
  - Transaction lifecycle and mutation errors
  - Query building, compilation, and execution errors
  - Storage and serialization errors

  ### Adapter Packages

  Each adapter now exports its own specific error classes:
  - **`@tanstack/electric-db-collection`**: Electric-specific errors
  - **`@tanstack/trailbase-db-collection`**: TrailBase-specific errors
  - **`@tanstack/query-db-collection`**: Query collection specific errors

  ## Breaking Changes
  - Error handling code using string matching will need to be updated to use `instanceof` checks
  - Some error messages may have slight formatting changes
  - Adapter-specific errors now need to be imported from their respective packages

  ## Migration Guide

  ### Core DB Errors

  **Before:**

  ```ts
  try {
    collection.insert(data)
  } catch (error) {
    if (error.message.includes('already exists')) {
      // Handle duplicate key error
    }
  }
  ```

  **After:**

  ```ts
  import { DuplicateKeyError } from '@tanstack/db'

  try {
    collection.insert(data)
  } catch (error) {
    if (error instanceof DuplicateKeyError) {
      // Type-safe error handling
    }
  }
  ```

  ### Adapter-Specific Errors

  **Before:**

  ```ts
  // Electric collection errors were imported from @tanstack/db
  import { ElectricInsertHandlerMustReturnTxIdError } from '@tanstack/db'
  ```

  **After:**

  ```ts
  // Now import from the specific adapter package
  import { ElectricInsertHandlerMustReturnTxIdError } from '@tanstack/electric-db-collection'
  ```

  ### Unified Error Handling

  **New:**

  ```ts
  import { TanStackDBError } from '@tanstack/db'

  try {
    // Any TanStack DB operation
  } catch (error) {
    if (error instanceof TanStackDBError) {
      // Handle all TanStack DB errors uniformly
      console.log('TanStack DB error:', error.message)
    }
  }
  ```

  ## Benefits
  - **Type Safety**: All errors now have specific types that can be caught with `instanceof`
  - **Unified Error Handling**: Root `TanStackDBError` class allows catching all library errors with a single check
  - **Better Package Separation**: Each adapter manages its own error types
  - **Developer Experience**: Better IDE support with autocomplete for error types
  - **Maintainability**: Error definitions are co-located with their usage
  - **Consistency**: Uniform error handling patterns across the entire codebase

  All error classes maintain the same error messages and behavior while providing better structure and package separation.

### Patch Changes

- Add initial release of TrailBase collection for TanStack DB. TrailBase is a blazingly fast, open-source alternative to Firebase built on Rust, SQLite, and V8. It provides type-safe REST and realtime APIs with sub-millisecond latencies, integrated authentication, and flexible access control - all in a single executable. This collection type enables seamless integration with TrailBase backends for high-performance real-time applications. ([#228](https://github.com/TanStack/db/pull/228))

## 0.0.7

### Patch Changes

- Add explicit collection readiness detection with `isReady()` and `markReady()` ([#270](https://github.com/TanStack/db/pull/270))
  - Add `isReady()` method to check if a collection is ready for use
  - Add `onFirstReady()` method to register callbacks for when collection becomes ready
  - Add `markReady()` to SyncConfig interface for sync implementations to explicitly signal readiness
  - Replace `onFirstCommit()` with `onFirstReady()` for better semantics
  - Update status state machine to allow `loading` → `ready` transition for cases with no data to commit
  - Update all sync implementations (Electric, Query, Local-only, Local-storage) to use `markReady()`
  - Improve error handling by allowing collections to be marked ready even when sync errors occur

  This provides a more intuitive and ergonomic API for determining collection readiness, replacing the previous approach of using commits as a readiness signal.

## 0.0.3

### Patch Changes

- Move Collections to their own packages ([#252](https://github.com/TanStack/db/pull/252))
  - Move local-only and local-storage collections to main `@tanstack/db` package
  - Create new `@tanstack/electric-db-collection` package for ElectricSQL integration
  - Create new `@tanstack/query-db-collection` package for TanStack Query integration
  - Delete `@tanstack/db-collections` package (removed from repo)
  - Update example app and documentation to use new package structure

  Why?
